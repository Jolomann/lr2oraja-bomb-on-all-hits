# If you don't know what LR2oraja or beatoraja is...

# What does this fork of LR2oraja achieve?
Normally in LR2 and beatoraja the bombs/explosions/hitlighting on note hits only show up on great/pgreat. This fork changes the behaviour to show them on all hits. There is no other difference

# I do not know how to build the .jar and have it actually run yet
But once I do, you'll hopefully be able to download this slight tweak of LR2oraja under releases

## Shoutout
Big thanks to NoName for figuring out how to do this in the first place. I'm just copying what he did and making the info public
