# What does this fork of LR2oraja achieve?
Normally in LR2 and beatoraja the bombs/explosions/hitlighting on note hits only show up on great/pgreat. This fork changes the behaviour to show them on all hits. There is no other difference

# How to use this edit
Place the .jar in your LR2oraja folder and launch. You can change the filename if you wish, but if you use .bat files to launch LR2oraja it may be easier to keep it as "beatoraja.jar". Remember to back up your original .jar file

## Shoutout
Big thanks to NoName for figuring out how to do this in the first place. I'm just copying what he did and making the info public
